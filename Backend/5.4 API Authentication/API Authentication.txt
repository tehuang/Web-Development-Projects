API Authentication: Sometimes, we want to protect our resources and only allow certain people to access them.

=============================
4 Levels of Authentication: 
=============================
0. No Authentication (Public API, anyone can use it) 
   - Setup rate limit. E.g. 100 requests/30min
   
1. Basic Authentication (Require username/password)
   - Require to setup 
   - Convert id/password to Base64 format and pass it to the header as a string
   - 
2. API Key Authorization
   - Instead of using an ID/password, which can be intercepted by hackers on the internet, an API key is utilized.
   - An API key is a reusable code that can be regenerated and deleted.
   - It can have rated limit

3. Token Base Authentication
   - Use token to interact with API after logging with ID/password
