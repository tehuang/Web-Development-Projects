Project Description:
This project aims to create an anonymous secret-sharing webpage. Users can share their secrets anonymously through the platform. 
The application enables users to sign up and log in using Google and Facebook authentication. Shared secrets will be stored in the database and displayed on the secret page.

Technical Requirements:
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
3. MongoDB: MongoDB will handle the storage of user object IDs and secrets.
4. Passport: Passport will serve as an authentication middleware for Node.js, facilitating the implementation of Google and Facebook authentication strategies.
