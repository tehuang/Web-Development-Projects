Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a ToDo List web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. 
The application will allow users to create and view tasks. These tasks will persist between sessions as a database will be integrated into the application. 
The final step includes deploying the application to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas for online accessibility.

Features: 
1. Able to render database items in the ToDoList application.
2. Able to add new items to the ToDoList application.
3. Able to delete items from the ToDoList application.
4. Able to create custom lists using express route parameters.
5. Able to add new items to the custom ToDoList. 
6. Able to delete items from the custom ToDOList. 

Technical Requirements
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
3. MongoDB Atlas: Mongoose will be used to communicate with MongoDB Atlas.
4. Heroku: Deploy the application on Heroku
