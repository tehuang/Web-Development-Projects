This "Memo" project is a React-based application designed for taking and managing notes. The project consists of several components, including Edit and List, and utilizes API endpoints for data retrieval and storage.

The Home component serves as the core interface, where users can create, edit, and delete memo entries. It manages the application's state using the useState hook, allowing users to see their memo list in real-time.

One of the key features of the project is the automatic data synchronization with a remote server. When the user makes changes to their memo list, the useEffect hook triggers the fetchSetData function to update the server's data via a PUT request, ensuring data persistence.

Additionally, the fetchData function retrieves the initial memo data from the server using a GET request and populates the local state, making the memo entries available for viewing and editing.

Overall, "Memo" is a simple yet functional note-taking application that leverages React and API endpoints to provide users with a seamless memo management experience.
