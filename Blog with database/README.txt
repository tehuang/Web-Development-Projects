Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a blog website using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to compose blog posts, and the created posts will persist between sessions by integrating a database into the application.

Things that have been done to set up a database for the blog:
1. Save composed Posts with MongoDB
2. Get the Home Page to Render the Posts
3. Render the blog post based on post _id

Technical Requirements: 
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
3. MongoDB Atlas: Mongoose will be used to communicate with MongoDB Atlas.
